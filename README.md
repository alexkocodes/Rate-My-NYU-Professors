## This is a google extension that displays the ratings of each professor from your classes on Albert! 

I am waiting for google to approve my extension. Once it is approved, it will be published on the Chrome Web Store. In the meantime, please feel free to download the source code and load the package on your own. It works the same way! I am also working on improving this extension and giving it more functionalities, so stay tuned for updates! 


## Here are the instructions for loading this extension locally: 
1. Download the source code and unzip the file. 
2. Go to chrome://extensions/ on your chrome browser. 
3. Click __Load unpacked__ on your top left corner and select the folder that you just unzipped. 
4. Make sure to toggle on this extension and pin it to your toolbar! 
5. Done!

## How this extension works: 
1. Go to any of your albert classes page (see below for example).
2. Click on the extension on your toolbar. 
3. Click __Click to Show Ratings__ button.
4. If there is any rating found for that professor, the number will show up next to their name. If no ratings found, nothing will show up!
5. Click on the rating to go to their rate my professor page. 
6. Enjoy selecting all your courses!
